The application can be given a login page for itself so that the users can log in through their Google or iCloud account directly. The knowledge that has been gained to develop this application can be used to create this application as new music streaming application, which can serve as a competitor to Spotify. The application can even be used to earn some revenue by having a
membership charge for premium and add free content.
